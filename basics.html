        <h1>Stock Investing Basics</h1>
        <p>Start here if you're new to stocks. We'll cover the fundamentals in simple terms—no jargon overload.</p>

      <h2>What Is a Stock?</h2>
      <p>A stock (also called equity or share) represents partial ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder and own a tiny piece of that business. If the company does well (profits grow, products sell), the stock price usually rises — and you can sell your shares later for more than you paid.</p>
      
      <h3>Two Main Types of Stock</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Common Stock</strong>: Most people buy this. Gives voting rights (usually 1 vote per share) and potential dividends, but you're last in line if the company goes bankrupt.</li>
        <li><strong>Preferred Stock</strong>: Higher claim on assets/dividends, usually no voting rights, behaves more like a bond + stock hybrid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Do You Make Money from Stocks?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Capital Gains</strong>: Buy low → sell high (most common way).</li>
        <li><strong>Dividends</strong>: Some companies pay part of profits to shareholders (quarterly or annually).</li>
        <li><strong>Stock Splits / Bonuses</strong> (less common but nice bonus).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Where Are Stocks Bought & Sold?</h2>
      <p>Through stock exchanges like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)</li>
        <li>Nasdaq</li>
        <li>Others around the world (Tokyo, London, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You buy/sell via a <strong>brokerage account</strong> (Robinhood, Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, Interactive Brokers, etc.).</p>
